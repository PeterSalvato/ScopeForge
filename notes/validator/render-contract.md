# Render Contract Rules

This file defines the structural and symbolic constraints for all PHP files responsible for rendering output in the Savepoint system â€” including routers and layout files.

All enforcement is static and must be validated by direct inspection or fixture matching.

---

## ðŸ§­ Scope of Enforcement

This contract applies to:
- All files in `/src/Router/`
- All files in `/src/Layout/`

---

## ðŸ”’ Router Requirements

Every Router must:

- Declare at top of file:  
  ```php
  $title = "Page Name";

    Use output buffering for content:

    ob_start();
    // Render content
    $content = ob_get_clean();

    May not assign $content directly with a string (e.g. $content = "<h1>Welcome</h1>";)

    Must not contain Layout::render() calls

    Must not include an <html> tag

    Must not use conditionals, loops, or dynamic logic of any kind

ðŸ”’ Layout Requirements

Layout files must:

    Only be resolved via LayoutResolver::resolve()

    Never use logic to decide which layout is chosen

    Never include conditional logic inside layout files

    Only wrap static content produced from routers

    Never perform rendering decisions or data evaluation

ðŸ“› Filename Format

All layout filenames must follow the format:

layout.[type].[context].php

Where:

    type = domain (e.g., journal, project, static)

    context = page or use (e.g., index, explainer, gallery)

Example:

layout.journal.index.php
layout.project.gallery.php

No camelCase, PascalCase, underscores, or mixed notation allowed.
ðŸ”Ž Fixture Reference

See:

    fixtures/router-contract/good.php

    fixtures/router-contract/bad.php

    fixtures/layout-contract/good.php

    fixtures/layout-contract/bad.php

These define the baseline for structure matching.
