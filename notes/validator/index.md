## ðŸ”Ž How to Traverse

Every rule is defined declaratively in its corresponding `.md` file.  
Every enforcement case has `good.*` and `bad.*` examples in `fixtures/`.

The validator reads this structure only. No rules are inferred.  
No logic is computed. All behavior is derived from authored files.
