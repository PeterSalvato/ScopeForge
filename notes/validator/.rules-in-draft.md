# Rules in Draft

This document is a sandbox for prospective validator rules that are **not yet enforceable**.

Nothing in this file is binding.  
No GPT or script may enforce any rule here.  
Once formalized, a rule must be moved into its own `*.md` spec file and registered in `VALIDATOR-PROTOCOL.md`.

---

## ⏳ Draft Candidate: Layout Pattern Enforcement

- Require that layouts be organized by domain:
  - `layout.journal.*.php`
  - `layout.project.*.php`
- Require that each layout have a matching router

→ Status: under review for feasibility

---

## ⏳ Draft Candidate: Page Weight Budget

- Enforce total HTML payload size under 60KB per page
- Flag oversized image inclusion by width or filesize
- Use fixture comparison or static inspection only

→ Status: requires static enforcement mechanism

---

## ⏳ Draft Candidate: Cross-Slug Link Verification

- Ensure that internal links:
  - Match known slugs from `site-manifest.yaml`
  - Do not reference non-existent pages

→ Status: dependent on `site-manifest.yaml` traversal

---

## ⏳ Draft Candidate: Journal Publish Time Consistency

- Every journal entry must:
  - Use ISO 8601 for internal timestamps
  - Match timestamp in Savepoint block
  - Match `dt-published` in HTML

→ Status: needs cross-file validator capability

---

## ⏳ Draft Candidate: Role Field Validator

- All `/fields/` pages must:
  - Declare `data-entity="Field"`
  - Use `@type: Role` or similar JSON-LD

→ Status: waiting for stable schema strategy

---

## ✅ When to Promote

To promote a rule:

1. Create a new file `rule-name.md` under `/docs/validator/`
2. Move the rule out of this file
3. Add it to `VALIDATOR-PROTOCOL.md` under a new or existing domain
4. Create fixtures for it

No rule becomes enforceable until this migration is complete.
